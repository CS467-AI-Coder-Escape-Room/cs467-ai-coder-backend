# React Escape Room AI Explorer

React Escape Room AI Explorer is a web application built using React, Three.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, designed to create a unique escape room experience that was built by comparing and utilizing different generative AI tools such as ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, Bard, GitHub CoPilot, AWS CodeWhisperer, and DALL-E based image based generators to name a few. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI technologies can help developers, junior and senior, be more productive. The secondary goal is to create a fun and engaging experience for everyone.

## Features

- Interactive 3D escape room environment built using React and Three.js.
- Leaderboard to showcase top players and encourage friendly competition.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
    ## For the client (React app)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CS467-AI-Coder-Escape-Room.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:
    ## For the client (React app)

    ```

    ## For the server (Express app)
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up your MongoDB database:

* For a local MongoDB database, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and update the connectionString in the server's .env file to match your local database.
* For a MongoDB Atlas database, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) and update the connectionString in the server's .env file to match your Atlas database.

Store your MongoDB connection string in a environment variable called MONGODB_URI in a .env file in the server directory.

5. Start the development servers:
    ## For the client (React app)
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

    ## For the server (Express app)
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm start
    ```

The React app will be available at http://localhost:3000, and the Express.js backend will run in process.env.PORT or by default  http://localhost:8000.
